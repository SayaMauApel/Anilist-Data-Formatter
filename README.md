# Anilist-Data-Formatter
This is a program designed to automatically request and format data from Anilist into usable, readable and scalable code more about anlist can be found here: https://anilist.co/ Since Anilist uses GraphQL API this program uses that API to request information everything done is client side and can be ran in command prompt. Some key things to note I have tried but failed to get this to run in Node.js I'm not sure for the exact cause however it does run in command prompt and I would recommend using that. I recommend using "npm install node-fetch@2" and "npm install node-fetch" though I think it runs with just npm install node-fetch but I am no longer sure. I plan to release a bit more updates in the future to fix bugs and clear up the syntax. If anyone has any questions or requests email me at magic.devmail@gmail.com.
